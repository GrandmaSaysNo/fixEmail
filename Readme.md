## Slated by request at a dinner table in Vegas.

sources of inspiration:

1) <b>Snapchat, stories delete after 24 hours.</b>
2) <b>Dave Thomas, email practices when on vacation.</b>
3) <b>Feedback at the table.</b>

<hr><b>Temporal inbox. </b>
<br>time to train users to use folders.

# Main Idea, Temporal Inbox:

1) folder exists named nastalgia, or usefulforreferance.
2) email deletes every two weeks.
3) email deletes every 24 hours.
4) if it is important move to aptly named folder or nastalgia.



7) look for trends to help out... spam/vsFriends/vsColleague/vsOtherRecurrantReason
8) notify for delete, if so choose, could be 
<br>... delete all from name
<br>... look deeper into name at individual email levels.
9) Other folder names: automatically moved, "old, better watch out".
10) "old 24 hours"
11) "old before 2 weeks"
12) "deleted after 2 weeks"
13) "urgent emails will be exempt from this list."

## The Dave Thomas disclamer:

<b>auto relpy email, </b>
<br>
<b><br>warning: the email you have sent has been deleted automatically. 
<br>If you would like the email read please mark it as urgent. 
<br>Thanks #name:</b>
